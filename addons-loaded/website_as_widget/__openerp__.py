website_as_widget
=================

Call webpages as widgets (without header or footer).

**Call the page from a subdomain called aswidget:**

http://aswidget.ahch.datadialog.net/shop

**Call the page with aswidget=True and the page widgeturl=%2Fshop :**

http://ahch.datadialog.net/?aswidget=True&widgeturl=%2Fshop

**Show the page normally again (with header and footer):**

http://ahch.datadialog.net/?aswidget=False
This will remove the aswidget=True from the current session

**Session and Domains:**

It is always better to call the i-frame url from a sub-domain URL (ahch.datadialog.net) because this will generate a
different session for the subdomain and so one could still call the website with header and footer (different session)
from the other domain (ahch.datadialog.net)

**HINT:** Keep in mind that session cookies can be shared from parent domains to child (sub) domains but not the
other way around!

**Embed the Page as an iFrame**
